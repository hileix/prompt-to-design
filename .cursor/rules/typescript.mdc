TypeScript Guidelines
- Use explicit typing rather than relying on inference when function interfaces are complex.
- Leverage union types, discriminated unions, and generics appropriately.
- Use interface for public APIs and type for complex types, unions, and intersections.
- Create reusable type utilities for common patterns.
